## what is this?

‚ôªÔ∏è boilerplate for a Python app

## what does it give you?

* _minimal_: doesn't presume _too_ much about your end goals (ML, embedded, web app, scraping)
* _sensible_: assumes you're using Git, want unit tests, &c.

üìù I've a similar project for [Flask app boilerplate](https://github.com/zachvalenta/create-flask-app)

## TODOS

* _add_: `requirements-dev/prod.txt`, `.editorconfig`
* _research_: https://www.python-boilerplate.com + https://github.com/reorx/project_sketch + https://github.com/mnebuerquo/virtuous-python + https://github.com/Luavis/create-flask-app + https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications
