# what is this?

‚ôªÔ∏è boilerplate for a Python app

# what does it give you?

* _minimal_: if [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is the kitchen sink, `create-python-app` is a cutting board 
* _sensible_: assumes you're using Git, want unit tests, &c.

üìù I've a similar project for [Flask app boilerplate](https://github.com/zachvalenta/create-flask-app)

# todo

* _add_: `requirements-dev/prod.txt`, `.editorconfig`
* _research_: https://www.python-boilerplate.com + https://github.com/reorx/project_sketch + https://github.com/mnebuerquo/virtuous-python + https://github.com/Luavis/create-flask-app + https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications + http://tjelvarolsson.com/blog/five-steps-to-add-the-bling-factor-to-your-python-package/
