# what is this?

* ♻️ boilerplate for a Python app

# tooling

* unit tests: [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)
* test coverage: [coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy)
* logging: [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru)

# what does it give you?

* __minimal__: if [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is the kitchen sink, `create-python-app` is a cutting board 
* __sensible__: assumes you're using Git, want unit tests, &c.

# how to use?

* clone repo
* remove the `.git` directory and initialize your own Git repo
* make the first commit in your new repo; your project has a good foundation!
